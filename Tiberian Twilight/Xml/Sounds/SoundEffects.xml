<!-- ; This file is the main list of sound effects in the game. Sounds in here are loaded,
; not streamed. Some additional sounds are listed in Music.xml (music tracks), 
; Speech.xml (stream voices), Voice.xml (non-streamed voices), and AmbientStream.xml
; (streamed ambients)
;
; The format of a sound entry is as follows:
; <SoundKeyword> <Name>
;    <Key>=<value>
;    <Key>=<value>
;    <Key>=<value>
; Endwhere: 
;  <SoundKeyword> introduces a new sound definition. There are 4 keywords; the choice of 
;   keyword determines the general type of sound and where the sound files are located. They are:
;    "AudioEvent":    This introduces a general use, non-streamed sound. Its sound is made from
;                     one or more WAVE format files located in Data/Audio/Sounds (and its localized
;                     subdirectories.
;    "MusicTrack":    This introduces a streamed piece of music. Music is located in Data/Audio/Tracks.
;                     Music is special in that playing one music track will (in most cases) cause any
;				      other music tracks to stop playing.
;    "DialogEvent":   This introduces a streamed piece of dialog. Streamed dialog is located in 
;                     Data/Audio/Speech. Streamed dialog is special in that the script commands used
;                     to play streamed dialog can prevent any other voices from playing until the 
;					  streamed dialog completes.
;    "AmbientStream": This introduces a streamed sound effect. These are located in 
;                     Data/Audio/AmbientStreams. AmbientStreams are special in that a request to
;                     play an ambient stream actually just produces an "ambient stream marker",
;                     and then the system uses the two loudest markers to choose which two ambient
;                     streams to play (so you cannot have more than 2 ambient streams playing at a time).
;    "StreamedSound": Acts much like a 2D sound, only it is streamed in. You set it to looped or unlooped,
;                     but you cannot have delays between the loops. Only 1 filename allowed
;
;  <Name> is the name of the sound. This is the name used to reference the sound in the other INI files,
;   the name which appear in WorldBuilder's sound lists, and the name which appears in error messages.
;   All names must be unique between all sounds (of any type).
;
;  <Key> is one of a number of keys defining how the sound is played. The list of legal keys 
;   and their possible values are:
;		"Filename": Name of (single) sound file to play. It should include the file extension, which can be 
;                   .wav for an uncompressed or IMA ADPCM-compressed WAVE file, or
;                   .mp3 for an MP3-compressed file. This key does NOT apply to AudioEvents.
;       "Sounds": List of WAVE files to play. This key applies ONLY to AudioEvents. You can include
;                 zero or more sounds on this list; the sound will usually (without the SEQUENTIAL flag) choose
;                 one randomly from the list. You do NOT include the file extension, which must be
;                 .wav. (Uncompressed or IMA ADPCM-compressed WAVE files accepted.) By default,
;                 all the sounds are equally likely to be chosen. This can be altered by adding a
;                 ':weight' after the sound file name. This changes the weight of the sound.
;                 The total weight of all sound files in the list is added up, and the chance of 
;                 any given sound file playing is (file's weight divided by total weight). The
;                 default weight is 1000. So a sound line like "Sounds=sound1 sound2:2000 sound3:200"
;                 means sound1.wav will play 1000/3200=31% of the time, sound2.wav will play 2000/3200=62%
;                 of the time, and sound3.wav will play 200/3200=6% of the time when the sound tries to play.
;                 (or on each loop, for looping sounds).
;
;					Weight=PlayPercentForThatSound*(TotalOtherWeights) / (1-PlayPercentForThatSound)
;
;					- Evan
;
;		"Attack": A list of WAVE files to play when starting up the sound. This key applies ONLY to 
;				  AudioEvents. If this key is not empty, one of the WAVE files listed here will be
;                 played when the sound is started up, before the sounds in the "Sounds" list. The
;				  format is exactly the same as the "Sounds" list. Note that if the sound starts 
;                 when it can't actually be heard (for instance, a 3D looping sound which is out of range),
;                 the "Attack" sound will be skipped when it finally becomes audible.
;		"Decay": A list of WAVE files to play when killing the sound. This key applies ONLY to 
;		 	     AudioEvents. If this key is present and not empty, one of the WAVE files listed
;                here will be played when the sound is killed. The format is exactly the same as
;				 the "Sounds" list.
;	    "Volume": The volume of the sound, as a percentage. This (multiplied by a host of global
;                 factors) gives the final output volume of the sound. 100 means play at full volume.
;				  Note that sounds never actually play above 100% volume. Giving a number above 100
;                 can be useful, though, since the default volumes of the volume sliders is generally
;                 around 70%, meaning at sound with Volume=120 will actually play at 84% of recorded
;                 volume, louder than a sound with Volume=100.
;		"VolumeShift": Specified as a negative percentage. If present, each time the sound is played, the
;                      volume will be randomly chosen between (volume + volumeshift) and (volume). E.g.
;                      if Volume=70 and VolumeShift=-20, the volume will be between 56 (70 * 0.8) and 70.
;                      (0.8=100% - 20%)
;       "PerFileVolumeShift": Same as VolumeShift, but 'rolled' (re-randomized) each time a new .wav is 
;                             started. Note: DOES NOT WORK for sounds with no delay in between the 
;                             wavs. 
;		"MinVolume" (For 3D AudioEvents and AmbientStreams only): If this is non-zero, the sound's volume 
;                   will never drop below this volume, regardless of how far away the microphone gets from
;                   the source of the sound. This clamping does not affect global volume controls (e.g.
;                   if the script has faded all sounds to zero or the user has selected a zero volume on
;                   the options window, the sound will still be silent.) Defaults to zero.
;		"PitchShift"
;       "PerFilePitchShift": Same as PitchShift, but 'rolled' (re-randomized) each time a new .wav is 
;                            started. Note: DOES NOT WORK for sounds with no delay in between the 
;                            wavs. 
;		"PlayPercent"
;		"Delay"
;		"Limit"
;		"":  lowest, low, normal, high, critical
;		"Type": One or more of the following flags. You can use the syntax +flag to add another
;               flag on a later line, and -flag to remove an existing flag (e.g. one listed in the 
;               default sound effect). Flags with no + or - override the existing list of 
;               flags.
;			"UI" (AudioEvents only): Sound is intended to be part of the UI. The only real effect of 
;                 this flag is that many sounds are sent to the audio manager by other pieces of code 
;                 without have a 'player which owns this sound' specified. If this flag is present, and 
;                 the "Player" flag is present, then if the owning play is not specified, the game 
;                 will assume the sound is supposed to be heard by the local player and play it.
;                 Without this flag, you get an assert, and the sound won't play. It has no effect
;                 at all unless combined with "Player".
;			"World" (AudioEvents only): Sound is 'in the world' - that is, it is meant to be a 3D sound.
;                    Sounds without this flag are *always* played as 2D sounds, even if given a
;                    position. Sounds with this flag will play as 3D sounds if possible, but will
;                    play as 2D sounds if no position is given. Note that MusicTracks and DialogEvents
;                    are always 2D streams, and AmbientStreams always look at their position if any.
;			"Shrouded" (For 3D AudioEvents and AmbientStreams only): If this flag is present, the sound
;                      will not play if its position is inside the shroud or fog of war. 
;			"Voice" (AudioEvents only): If this sound is attached to an object, the sound will not play if
;                   another sound with the "voice" flag is already playing on it, unless the sound also has
;                   the interrupting control flag set. As a secondary effect, this flag defaults SubmixSlider
;                   to "Voice" if no SubmixSlider is given.
;			"Player" (AudioEvents only): In some cases, when a sound is played, the code gives it a owning
;                    player. (If the sound is attached to an object, the owner of the object is usually the 
;					 owner of the sound.) In these cases, the flags Player, Allies, Enemies, and Everyone are
;                    used to determine who can hear the sound. If the "Player" flag is present, the owning
;					 player will be able to hear the sound; if neither "Player" nor "Everyone" is present,
;                    the owner of the sound will not be able to hear it. 
;                      AudioEvents should *always* have one or more of "Player", "Allies", "Enemies", or 
;                    "Everyone", otherwise you will get an assert when you try to play the sound.
;			"Allies" (AudioEvents only): If the sound is owned by a player, this flag indicates that the
;                    allies of that player can hear the sound.
;			"Enemies" (AudioEvents only): If the sound is owned by a player, this flag indicates that the
;                     enemies of that player can hear the sound.
;			"Everyone" (AudioEvents only): This flag indicates that all players can hear a sound, regardless
;                      of the sound's owner. Note that if a sound isn't given an owner (true of many UI sounds,
;                      and all Large Group Audio sounds), "Everyone" is the only acceptable flag of the four -
;                      you will get an assert if you don't list the sound as "Everyone", and the sound will 
;                      play as if the "everyone" flag was present anyway.
;			"Fake":
;			"Default":
;		"Control": More flags. Again, the +/- flag syntax can be used to modify existing lists of flags.
;			"Loop" (AudioEvents and DialogEvents only): If this flag is present, the sound will loop forever -
;                  or at least until killed. With this flag, the sound will play an Attack sound, and then 
;                  play one of the sounds from the Sounds lists forever until something kills the sound, at
;                  which point it will play a Decay sound. Without this flag, the sound would just play 
;                  1 Attack, 1 Sound, and 1 Decay sound. 
;                    Sounds with this flag are sometimes known as "permanent" sound, while sounds without
;				   this flag are known as "one-shot" sounds. In general, you can use a one-shot sound
;                  where a permanent sound is expected; for instance, as the sound for a Large Group Audio
;                  map, or as a move loop. However, you should NOT use permanent sounds where one-shot 
;                  sounds are expected; the code will not kill the sound and it will last until the level is
;                  exited. 
;                    AmbientStreams are always looping. Music is looping or not depending on the script command
;                  used to start it.
;			"Sequential": (AudioEvents only) For loops, run through each of the sounds in the Sounds list
;                  in order, instead of the normal randomly choosing one on each loop. After the last wav
;                  is played, the first wav is played again.
;			"Randomstart":
;			"Interrupt":
;			"Fade_on_kill":
;			"Fade_on_start":
;		"MinRange" (For 3D AudioEvents and AmbientStreams only): If the source of the sound is closer than 
;                  this distance (in WorldBuilder distance units), the sound will play at full volume.
;                  Beyond this, the volume will fall off linearly until it reaches zero volume at MaxRange.
;		"MaxRange" (For 3D AudioEvents and AmbientStreams only): The maximum distance at which the 
;                  sound can be heard. If the 3D distance between the microphone and the sound is greater
;                  than this, the sound will not play - unless tha MinVolume is greater than zero, in which
;                  case the sound will still play outside the MaxRange. In the latter case, MaxRange only 
;                  helps determine the volume rolloff line (which is a straight line from full volume at
;                  MinRange to zero at MaxRange).
;		"LowPassCutoff" (For 3D AudioEvents only): This field is used to cause off-screen sounds to
;                       become occluded. This is a percentage from 0 to 100%. If it is greater than zero,
;                       sounds whose location is off-screen will be set to be (100 - LowPassCutoff) percent
;                       occluded. On the sound providers we currently use, this causes the sounds to be both
;                       muted overall and to have a low-pass filter applied to them (see the Miles function
;                       AIL_set_3D_sample_occlusion). 
;                         Note that the sense of this number is backwards. A LowPassCutoff of 0 is hard-coded
;                       to mean "no occlusion"; however, a LowPassCutoff of 1 will cause the maximum possible
;                       occlusion (99% occluded). Higher LowPassCutoffs will decrease the occlusion until, at
;                       LowPassCutoff=100, there will be no occlusion. (But the system will still waste time
;                       checking if the sound is off-screen, so use LowPassCutoff of 0, not 100!) 
;		"DryLevel" (For 2D sounds and Ambient Streams only): When reverb is on, this is the per-sample 
;                  level of the dry sound signal (the non-reverbed sound), as a percent. 0 - 100%
;		"ReverbEffectLevel": For 2D sounds and Ambient Streams, when reverb is on, this is the per-sample 
;                            level of the wet sound signal (the reverberations), as a percent. 0 - 100% 
;							 For 3D AudioEvents only, when reverb is on, this is the % amount the reverb 
;							 affects the sound. 0 - 100%
;		"SubmixSlider": Determines which of the five volume sliders on the options page controls this 
;                       sound's volume, and which script commands. The choices are:
;						"SoundFX", "Voice",	"Music", "Ambient", and	"Movie". If no SubmixSlider
;                       key is given, the Voice slider is used if the VOICE type flag is used,
;                       otherwise AudioEvents use "SoundFX", MusicTracks use "Music", DialogEvents
;						use "Voice", and "AmbientStreams" use "Ambient".
;		"VolumeSliderMultiplier": While this sound is playing, cause all other sounds which use a
;								  specified SubmixSlider to change volume (usually, become quieter).
;								  The format is "VolumeSliderMultiplier=Slider:<Name> Multiplier:<Percent>"
;								  The slider name is one of the SubmixSliders listed above; multiplier is 
;								  a percentage multiplier to slider volume. For instance, the line
;								  VolumeSliderMultiplier=Slider:Voice Multiplier:70 means that any other
;								  sounds which use the Voice slider have their volumes multiplied by 0.7 while
;								  this sound plays. A sound may have more than 1 VolumeSliderMultiplier entry,
;								  and all sounds with a VolumeSliderMultiplier entry are immune to all 
;								  VolumeSliderMultipliers. If it is "None", NO volume adjustments will be
;                                 made, ever.
;		"ZoomedInOffscreenVolumePercent":  When zoomed in completely, multiply far-offscreen sounds' Volumes

;Features from Jason Poon:
;
;- Evan: Audioevent attached to the decommissioning of units when using the delete button hotkey.
;
;Jason: After some investigation this was able to be done using existing tech. For example if you open basecrawlerobject.xml search for LifetimeUpdate.  The TimeBetweenCountdownSounds cannot be set to the maxLifetime otherwise it will go straight to playing the CountdownCompleteSound audioevent which is played at the end of the Lifetime.
;
;Evan:  We ended up not using this method.  Instead Jason created a model condition for decommissioning.  
;
;                  <LifetimeUpdate
;                        id="ModuleTag_DisableCrawlerLifetimeUpdate"
;                        MinLifetime="10s"
;                        MaxLifetime="10s"
;                        WaitForWakeUp="true"
;                        DeathType="SUICIDED"
;                        CountdownSound="GDI3-1_TractorBeam_StrA_PowerDownCaptured"
;                        TimeBetweenCountdownSounds="9s"
;                        ShaderOverride="ShaderOverride_EMP"/>
;
;
;- Evan:  Loop an AudioEvent for X seconds, useful for NOD Aftershock Tiberium Vein Cloud (NODVehicleAFWeapon_Deployed_CreateCloud).
;
;Jason: In order to do this you need to add the highlighted line to the audioevent definition.  This LoopTime will only be used if the LOOP Control flag is specified.

;- Nick:  "Our unit is under attack!", "We’ve lost a unit commander!", These lines should only play if the event that triggers them is off screen. This is being done to reduce unnecessary clutter in the Eva lines during MP matches.

; Also in this file are Multisounds. Format is:
;  Multisound <name>
;      Subsounds=<subsound> <subsound> <subsound>
;      [Control=PLAY_ONE]
;  End
;
;
; New feature added to Multisound where you can override Volume, VolumeShift, PitchShiftLow, PitchShiftHigh, and PlayPercent within the Subsound syntax.  Really would like multipliers though.
;
; <Subsound Volume="22" VolumeShift="-5" PitchShiftLow="5" PitchShiftHigh="30" PlayPercent="100">GDI_MissileSoldier_MissileFire1</Subsound>
;
;	===================================================
;
; New featurea added by Jason Poon, 10/1/2009 for CNC4:
;	Multisounds can now be specified with time delays.  If there are nested Multisounds possessing delay values the total of all the delays will be used.  For example:
;
;                <Multisound id="GDI_CrawlerBOffense_VoiceSelectMS" Delay="6666">
;                                <Subsound>GDI_CrawlerBOffense_VoiceSelect</Subsound>
;                                <Subsound>GDI_CrawlerBVehicle_SoundSelectMS</Subsound>
;                </Multisound>
;
;	===================================================
;
; A multisound can be used almost anywhere a normal sound is used. When a multisound is played, all of the 
; listed subsounds will be played instead. (Multisounds can even be listed as subsounds in another multisound!)
; The subsounds can be completely different from each other - they can have different priorities, type flags,
; control flags, ranges, etc. You can even list several different types of flags (Music, Sound Effects, 
; Ambient Streams, etc) in a single Multisound. 
; If the optional "Control=PLAY_ONE" flag is given, then only ONE of the subsounds will be played when
; the multisound is requested. The PLAY_ONE flag applies only to Multisounds. None of the other flags apply
; to Multisounds. -->
